# Koka Experiments and Libraries

Koka is a small research language which is functional first, has ML style syntax and uses effect types to cleanly and conveniently manage side effects.

This repository contains the code I wrote in my short time experimenting with Koka, to see what it is like and what it is capable of.

For information on the Koka programming language see the [github repository](https://github.com/koka-lang/koka) or the [official documentation](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html).
