# Koka Experiments and Libraries

For information on the Koka programming language see the [github repository](https://github.com/koka-lang/koka) or the [official documentation](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html#why-effects).

Koka is a small research language I have been fiddling around with which is very interesting and has a lot to like, but has very poor documentation (as with many small languages). This repository is my experimentation with the language, and some code that may become useful in future if I decide to invest in Koka as a technology to use in more serious projects.
